# Idea Outline


-(Anthropomorph) Twitter convo -> two entities (pixel bunnies?) that chat to each other about topics picked at random.
-They draw their utterances from the twitter api and use speech synthesis in Chrome to actually talk. 
-Topics reset from time to time and some configuration should be available (filters, topic lists, convo length/time, etc.)

# Dependencies I will probably need
- node twitter module
- nodejs
- some sort of cli formatter for node

- socket.io

- chrome
- html5/js/css8
- mspaint for bunnies :3

# Name ideas
- fleek-chat (always on point.. not)
